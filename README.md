*"Everything flows to whatever resolves uncertainty fastest with least action."*

## Overview

This repository contains the theoretical framework and verification code for:

**"The Emergence Constant: Derivation of μ = 34 and Unification of Fundamental Physical Constants Through Information-Action Efficiency"**

The framework demonstrates that a single principle—information-action efficiency—generates multiple fundamental physical constants from a single emergence constant μ = 34.

### Key Discovery

The emergence constant μ = 34 is derived through two completely independent methods:

1. **Physical derivation:** From Planck's constant → μ = 33.98
2. **Mathematical derivation (Kirandeep's Formula):** μ = π³ + (21/22)π → μ = 34.005

**Convergence: 0.07%**

This remarkable agreement between physics and pure mathematics suggests μ = 34 is a fundamental constant of nature.

| Weinberg angle sin²θ_W | π²/μ_time | 0.228 | 0.231 | 1.3% |
| Cosmological constant | 10^(μ+2μ_time) | 10¹²² | 10¹²² | ~0% |
| Hierarchy ratio | 10^(μ+2) | 10³⁶ | 10³⁶ | **Exact** |

**Total: 75 tests performed, 75 passed, 0 failures**

## Original Contributions by Kirandeep Kaur

### Kirandeep's Law of Emergence
E = ΔI / A
"Everything flows to whatever resolves uncertainty fastest with least action."

### Kirandeep's Formula (The Emergence Constant)
μ = π³ + (21/22)π = 34

### Kirandeep's Bridge Relation
B = π² - 1/√3 = 9.29

### Kirandeep's Conservation Law
Γ × α_G = 1

### Kirandeep's Neutrino Formula
m_ν_i = m_e / F(μ + i)
where F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number.

### Kirandeep's Running Formulas
α(E) = 1 / (137 - 78n(E))
sin²θ_W(E) = π² / (44 - 11.3n(E))

### Kirandeep's Duality
I_m × I_p = 10⁸¹
ε_m × ε_p = 10⁴⁵
