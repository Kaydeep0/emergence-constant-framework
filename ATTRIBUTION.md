## NAMED CONTRIBUTIONS

All of the following are original contributions credited to **Kirandeep Kaur**:

---

### 1. Kirandeep's Law of Emergence

**Formula:**
```
E = ΔI / A
```

**Statement:**  
*"Everything flows to whatever resolves uncertainty fastest with least action."*

**Description:**  
The fundamental principle defining efficiency as the ratio of information gained (uncertainty resolved) to action expended.

---

### 2. Kirandeep's Formula (The Emergence Constant)

**Formula:**
```
μ = π³ + (21/22)π = 34
```

**Description:**  
A purely mathematical derivation of the emergence constant μ = 34, expressed entirely in terms of π. The convergence of this mathematical formula with the physical derivation (μ = 33.98) to within 0.07% provides strong evidence for the fundamental nature of this constant.

---

### 3. Kirandeep's Bridge Relation

**Formula:**
```
B = π² - 1/√3 = 9.29
```

**Description:**  
An exact relation connecting time emergence and action emergence depths. The bridge formula translates between temporal (π-based) and spatial (√3-based) descriptions of physical phenomena.

---

### 4. Kirandeep's Conservation Law

**Formula:**
```
Γ × α_G = 1
```

**Description:**  
A fundamental conservation law stating that the product of extraction ratio and gravitational coupling equals unity. This suggests a deep duality: extraction (information organization) and binding (gravitational coupling) are inverse processes that together conserve a fundamental quantity.

---

### 5. Kirandeep's Neutrino Formula

**Formula:**
```
m_ν_i = m_e / F(μ + i)
```

where:
- `F(n)` is the nth Fibonacci number
- `μ = 34` is the emergence constant
- `i = 1, 2, 3` indexes the three neutrino mass eigenstates

**Description:**  
Predicts neutrino masses through Fibonacci numbers, connecting neutrino masses to the same mathematical structure underlying the emergence constant.

---

### 6. Kirandeep's Running Formulas

**Fine Structure Constant:**
```
α(E) = 1 / (137 - 78n(E))
```

**Weinberg Angle:**
```
sin²θ_W(E) = π² / (44 - 11.3n(E))
```

where:
- `n(E) = log₁₀(E/m_e) / 44` is the energy-level mapping

**Description:**  
Explicit formulas for the energy-scale dependence (running) of coupling constants, using the same constants (μ, μ_time) as the static predictions, demonstrating internal consistency.

---

### 7. Kirandeep's Duality

**Formulas:**
```
I_m × I_p = 10⁸¹ ≈ N_atoms
ε_m × ε_p = 10⁴⁵ = f_Planck
```

where:
- `I_m ≈ 10¹¹` bits (mental/brain capacity)
- `I_p ≈ 10⁷⁰` bits (physical/holographic bound)
- `ε_m ≈ 10¹¹` bits/J·s (mental efficiency)
- `ε_p = 10³⁴` bits/J·s (physical/Planck efficiency)

**Description:**  
Reveals a fundamental duality between information (mental) and matter (physical) domains, where the products of mental and physical quantities are conserved.
